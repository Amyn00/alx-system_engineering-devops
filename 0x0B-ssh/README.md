# 0x0B. SSH

## Background Context

Along with this project, you have been attributed an Ubuntu server, living in a datacenter far far away. Like level 2 of the application process, you will connect using `ssh`. But contrary to level 2, you will not connect using a password but an RSA key. We’ve configured your server with the public key you created in the first task of a [previous project](https://github.com/Amyn00/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/master/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing) shared in your `intranet profile`.

You can access your server information in the `my servers` section of the intranet, each line with contains the IP and username you should use to connect via `ssh`.

**Note**: Your server is configured with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.
